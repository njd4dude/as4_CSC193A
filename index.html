      <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
      <p>
        Neural networks are basically big complex <strong>functions</strong>.
        They have an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The most
        simplest demonstration of a neural network is a
        <strong>dense</strong> neural network which consists of multiple dense
        layers. Each layer is a set of neurons which are connected to the next
        layer. The connections between the neurons are called weights.
